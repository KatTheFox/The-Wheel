# The Wheel

> With each turn its cilia pulse and wriggle and its body flushes translucent to crimson. It might be ugly but it is beautiful like the withdrawing of blood from the labyrinths of glass. It does not cease and all its involutions are infinite. The Wheel.

The Wheel is a time control mod for [Cultist Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator), a 2018 game by Weather Factory.

## What does it do?

The Wheel adds a slider to the options menu, which lets you control how fast the 'Fast Forward' speed option is. It also adds the ability to bind keys to skip forward in time by 1 second, 10 seconds, or until the next recipe completion.

# Installation instructions

The easiest way to install The Wheel is from the [Steam Workshop release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913462842). You will also need to install and enable [GHIRBI, the Gatekeeper](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2901287611), an official mod by Weather Factory that enables DLL mods.

Note that the mod may or may not function correctly on the stable branch; it is built against the `gateofhorn` beta branch, which can be enabled on both Steam and GOG. Anything beyond that, you're on your own.

If you aren't on the Steam version of Cultist Simulator, you can download the latest version of The Wheel via [Github Releases](https://github.com/KatTheFox/The-Wheel/releases/latest), and GHIRBI from [Weather Factory's website](https://weatherfactory.biz/ghirbi-the-gatekeeper/).

### To uninstall the mod

Unsubscribe from it on the Steam Workshop, or (for non-Steam users) delete the "The Wheel" folder from your mods directory. You can easily find that by pausing Cultist Simulator and clicking the 'browse files' button at the bottom of the settings menu.
